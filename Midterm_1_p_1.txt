pivot longer:
column name = names_to
values_to = the values of the wide df column name

obesity_2 = the estimated population, obese population, and obesity rate of different sexes of different zip codes that, excluding minors, have zip codes of 8 age group samples irrespective of sex. 

education = education but instead of having a row per zip code there is now 1 row per each zip-sex combination, where w is the appropriate pct_male_bach or pct_female_bach depending on the new sex column

education_2 = a df that has the obesity rate and bachelor-holding population for each zip sex combination that education and obesity_2 have in common (this implies that obesity rate of different sexes of different zip codes that, excluding minors, have zip codes of 8 age group samples irrespective of sex)

summary_2 = U is obesity rate by sex V is the bachelors percentage by sex of different zip codes that, excluding minors, have zip codes of 8 age group samples irrespective of sex
